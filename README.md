# BO3K_ZIP

This is a crack for Zip files that uses a dictionary.

Hi, I'm BO3K member / collaborator of Security Hack Labs, developer of Error404 and founder of Kryptón Security, here I leave you the free code of the crack of zip files. Be free to modify it, it works with a very complete dictionary (diccionary.txt). But you can modify it with data you have from the author or use another available dictionary, I will be adding others.

In thanks to Error 404, Security Hack Labs and Kryptón Security for the support they have given me.
